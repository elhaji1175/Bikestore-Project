# sql
The bikestore sample database, is a dataset that i made containing around 10 columns
The columns that i managed to get from the sql are order_id,name,city,state,order_date,total_units,revenue,product_name,category name,store_name,sales_rep
I used the joins constraint to be able to make this as one table
i further did the analysis of the table in Excel where i managed to make great visuals and a dashboard for the dataset
I have also apploaded the excel workbook that i worked upon as bikestorproject.xlsb
